	  <p>In January, Scott took a skiing trip with our friends Matthew and Fabiola. And soon after that I went to Toulouse for a conference. From there, I went to Dusseldorf, Winnekendonk, and Dortmund where I visited with my friend Matthias and his family and got to see a KÃ¶lner Haie hockey game and a Dortmund soccer game.</p>

	  Back in Edmonton we had a long consultation with Daniel's medical team. After a lengthy and comprehensive evaluation process, it was time for us to reckon with the reality that Daniel will not be an independent adult and will need support throughout his life. A combination of attention deficit, learning disabilities, and his existence toward the end of the spectrum of general anxiety makes it very difficult for him to participate in organized activities and to hold a job. Thus, we have spent an extensive amount of time and effort to set up all the legal, medical, and government administrative processes in order to obtain the legal status and assistance that he needs. We are happy to report that, after almost a year of patient and persistent work, Daniel now has all the designations that he needs. Daniel continues to live at home and enjoys the company of our dog, a few friends, and his video games. He traveled with us in 2023. Daniel has quit high school. His psychiatrist put it best when he said that, given his challenges, instead of thinking of him as dropping out of school, we have to think of him as an overachiever for having made it all the way to high school.  Given our personal histories of affirming ourselves in ways that do not conform with general expectations, it was interesting to live through a "coming out" process of informing friends that the expectations of finishing high-school and transitioning to college that apply to neurotypical late teens and young adults do not apply to Daniel.

	  In March, I was in Montreal where I was serving as the general chair for an international conference in Computer Architecture. I was very proud of my graduate students and post-doc for receiving a distinguished-paper award at the important Code Generation and Optimization conference. During that visit, I managed to see my cousin Alessandra, Felipe, and Bruno.

	  <p>We have been patronizing the Ballet Edmonton for several years. In March we won a trip for two to Ottawa in a raffle fundraiser for the Ballet. Scott and I got to have dinner with the Ballet company, to see a wonderful and successful show, the first of the company at the National Arts Centre, and got to see some of the sites in Ottawa.</p>

	  <p>Soon after their arrival in Brazil, Scott, Daniel, my mother, and myself took a long bus trip to go to S&atilde;o Luiz Gonzaga, the city where I was born. But, in the middle of the long trip we had an afternoon stay in Santo &Acirc;ngelo where we were received like returning kings by my cousin Neuri, his wife Silvia, and part of their family. They went out of their way to prepare an elaborate traditional Gaucho barbecue in the middle of the afternoon for us. But, most important, they received us with so much love and warmth. I had not seen them for a very long time and it was great to reconnect. Our very good friend Maristela was able to stop by to visit with us while we were there.

  <p>The Matriz Church in S&atilde;o Luiz Gonzaga is a very important site. It is an imposing site in the main square and there is a connection with my family: my mother's father was a laborer in the construction of that church. This is also the church where all the baptisms, weddings, confirmations, funerals, in the family have taken place. I spent much time during my youth in this church when I was an active member of the youth catholic group there.

	  <p>I accepted an invitation to be one of the instructors at the HiPEAC ACACES Summer school, which takes place in Fiuggi every year. It brings together about 200 Ph.D. students from schools all over Europe -- the students are from all over the globe, and about ten instructors. It was one of the best experiences in terms of academic international traveling. We stayed in a resort hotel, had great Italian food, and I spent lots of time having great meaningful conversations with Ph.D. students about academics, career, and life. I have created a seminar about communication in science, which I also delivered at ACACES besides delivering my technical course on High-Performance Computing. It was great to have students writing to me months later saying how much my seminar had helped them. I had a short stay in a very hot and very crowded Rome before heading to Porto where I also delivered my seminar and participated in an international conference.

	  <p>I was very happy to meet and catch up with Michael Wolfe while attending a conference in Salt Lake City in August. Michael is the author of a seminal textbook that I use to teach. He was a principal engineer at NVIDIA for many years, and he has made significant contributions to code analysis. Michael was receiving a test-of-time award and it was great to also hear that he admires the work that we do in my research group. A July trip to academic conferences in Orlando included a visit to the Cape Canaveral NASA museum. In September I was very proud of the work done by my students that led us to receive a best-paper award at a conference in Las Vegas. In Edmonton it was great to receive my colleague Steven Bates for a visit to the university in October. Several of my students graduated this Summer and moved on to new positions. It is great to be part of the university system and to see student's progress. In the picture are my M.Sc. student Rouzbeh and my pos-doc Jo&atilde;o Carvalho.

	  <p>Late in August I took a trip to HotChips in Stanford University. This is the conference where major processor designers reveal their most recent microprocessor developments. I was happy to meet colleagues whose work I admire, such as Uday Bonghugula. One chance encounter that led to interesting conversations was with Ian Cutress, a British technology analyst who has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TechTechPotato">YouTube channel called Tech Tech Potato</a> with a large following among techies. Rubbing shoulders with such a celebrity gives me some street cred with my undergraduate students ;-).

	  <p>There were two opportunities to hangout with my SBAC crowd this year. First, during the conference which took place at PUCRS in Porto Alegre. SBAC is an international conference that originated in Brazil in the late 1980s. It was the first conference that I ever attended, and PUCRS is the university where I got my undergraduate degree from. Thus, it made sense for me to be there. We had a lovely evening out at a bar recommended by my friend Daniel Petry while we were there. Then, when I attended Supercomputer 23, the largest event for high-performance computing in the world, Jairo Panetta, one of my earliest casual mentors in technology and academics, was delivering an important talk about the evolution of the use of high-performance computing in Brazil and in Latin America. It was a great opportunity to hangout with Brazilian colleagues in a major international venue.

	  <p>The most intense wild-fire season in recorded history in Canada made Spring and Summer life difficult at times. For weeks at a time we had to go back to mask-wearing to go outside for any extended period of time. Still, we continue to enjoy taking Junior for long walks, and cultivating a plentiful vegetable garden.

	  <p>With Daniel's condition keeping him mostly housebound and in need of someone to be home with him, Scott and I have developed a tag-team system where I am frequently in my academic travels and he is off to the mountains whenever he can. He has developed a group of friends who enjoy hiking in the Summer and skiing in the Winter. Scott's hiking friends include Stuart Howe who is famous for his Howe's the Hike YouTube Channel. Scott and friends appear in very interesting videos from their hikes, including this one to <a href="https://youtu.be/0j7jMXhDH_o?si=vxO9bioRF_OrpHds">Castleguard Meadows via Saskatchewan Glacier</a>. When not hiking/skiing, Scott is studying and planning for that, helping to support Daniel at home, and keeping company to Junior. In December we had a great time with our friends Roger and Elaine with a Feuerzangenbowle Christmas celebration, a German tradition for Christmas.

	  <p>This year Scott and Daniel visited with his parents and family in Oklahoma in the two weeks before Christmas. It was an important visit because he is trying to assist them as they become more frail. It was also their first visit after Scott's nephew, Braden, suddenly passed away in November.  I stayed in Edmonton to set, proctor, and grade my final exams for my large classes at the university. Junior kept me company. They returned on Christmas day in time for us to organize a dinner with friends at home before Scott took off for a long backcountry skiing trip in British Columbia. We continue trying to find the best ways in which we can continue supporting Daniel while leading active and fulfilling lives.</p>

  <o>All the best on 2024.</p>
