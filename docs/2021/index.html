	 <p>Winter of 2021 was a quiet time, I continued my exploration of Ottolenghi's cooking. There were lots of long walks in the dog park. Sometimes with friends joining us for a walk. To regain some of the benefits of dining/visiting experiences with friends, after the long lockdown, we organized Zoom dinners where each group of friends cooked one of the courses, we met, exchanged the food, and went back to our own homes to eat the dishes while chatting over Zoom.</p>

	 <p> Back in the days when travel was frequent, from time to time I would wander into an art gallery or into a crafts market and, now and then, I would buy a unique piece of art. To make up for the absence of travel, I found Jovan over the internet, a glass artist from Okanagan Stained Glass Crafts, and comissioned a unique small mirror to hang in our bathroom. I sent him pictures of unique pieces of art that I bought over the years and that I have in the house for him to have a sense of the colors and styles that I like. He sent me pictures of work that he had done in the past and sketches for the new mirror. It was a fun experience to work with Jovan on the concept and design, and then to see the final piece when it arrived.</p>

  <p>One way that Scott found to stay active and engaged during the long Alberta Winters was to take up back-country skiing. After a few trips to the back country, he decided that he needed to get into better shape and decided to go for a solo downhill ski trip to Marmot, a challenging ski slope close to Jasper. Unfortunatelly, he pushed himself too much and ended up with a broken leg that required a surgery and the instalation of some metal to keep the bone structure working. This accident led to six weeks of no weight bearing on that leg. Even with the addional burden or shopping/cooking/cleaning on top of my regular job activities, I managed to arrange my schedule so that I could take him, on a wheelchair, for daily walks to the large dog park with trails in the Buena Vista park. </p>

  <p>The arrival of the Spring and the relaxing of the lockdown rules enabled us to meet friends outdoors. Even though we did not partake in the "Best Summer Ever" promoted by the government of Alberta, we did enjoy several dinners with friends and neighbors in our backyard, and had one late Fall dinner indoors. Sometimes, these were "Junior-friend's dinners" because we would have met everyone around the table through our dog walks. We also planted our extensive Summer garden and shared its bounty with friends.</p>

  <p>During the Summer I hired a group of four undergraduate students to both assist me with the setup for my Fall teaching and to get them started in research. The combination of this group of students with my existing and incoming graduate students kept me very Zoomcupied throughout the Summer. My routine was to start the day with a group meeting to review everyone's progress and then schedule individual meetings through the day as needed. A couple of my students finished their M.Sc. research work and graduated by the end of the Summer. Our work also included intensive collaborations with industry partners and with my close collaborator at Unicamp. And then, toward the end of the Summer I was able to invite groups of students for some cooking and visiting out in the backyard, and we also did a dog-park walk with Junior. It was good to be able to do a few social activities with the student after a long time of Zoom-only interactions.</p>

	  <p>The day that Scott came back home from his surgery stay at the hospital in April, he sat on the couch and start looking for backcountry huts in the mountains to book for late-Summer hikes. By July Scott and John Shaw took off on Scott's first post-operation hiking trip to the mountains. And then, in September, they went on a much more adventurous longer hike with a friend. As soon as there was enough snow on the ground, Scott started practicing skiing in town to see if he was able to ski again. Before the year was out, he had gone in two skiing trips, including one to the backcountry with temperatures below -22C for the daytime. The man is unstoppable. He got back in shape through sheer determination, pushing himself to go up and down long stairs in the park even when his leg was still hurting.</p>

<p>Returning to campus in September was a tumultuous affair. As late as the mid of August, the University of Alberta intention was for a return to campus without any mask or vaccine requirements and it was not clear that the air quality in classrooms had been reviewed properly. I wrote a letter to the local newspaper that speared other folks into action to petition the university administration for more strict measures. I ended up given a short interview to the local TV News cast. The University president wrote a letter to the campus community saying that he understood the concerns but that nothing would change. Less than a week later they had reversed their position and made the wearing of masks a requirement. It was the end of the Government of Alberta illusion that the pandemic was over. Still, wading through crowds of students to get to a lecture hall was a new experience after the lockdown. I taught all my three courses in person throughout the Fall semester. But I gave the students the option to watch live-streamed or recorded lectures and most of the assignments could be completed remotely. The only in-person requirement was the writing of exams. Over time, more and more students opted to not show up for the in-person lecture experience. This may be correlated with the arrival of snow and colder temperatures in Edmonton as well. It was still a great experience to go and lecture in person to the students that did come to class.</p>

<p>Artem is from Russia. He has a brother and nephews in Edmonton. Soon after I visited with him in Vancouver, Artem was in Edmonton to visit with his parents and we managed to invite him and his parents for a dog-park walk with Junior on a cold snowy day. And later, while Artem was in Abu Dhabi to watch live what turned out to be an exciting final of the Formula 1 Grand Prix, I was taking his parents to a tour of the University Alberta campus and we hosted them for a brunch in our house. They have a very interesting life history and are both a great conversation. We are very happy to have made their acquaintance.</p>

<p>In November I invited some students to join me to go back to see a University of Alberta Golden Bears game in the Clare Drake arena. It was great to be back in the place where Daniel and I watched many hockey games when he was little. The Bears lost that evening, but it was a great evenly matched game. And the Bears did beat the Saskatchewan Bison's the next day at the same place.</p>

	<p>As president of thee Windsor-Park Community League, Scott organized an outdoor social gathering for Christmas. They hired a service to put lights on the trees outside of the Hall and they set up several outdoor fires for people to gather around. There was hot chocolate and story reading. Daniel helped to man the fires. Everyone was commenting that it was great that the weather had warmed up to -14C for that evening event.</p>

	  <p>And now we seem to be getting back to lock-down conditions because of a fresh new wave of Covid cases. Lets hope that we do weather this wave well and are able to gather in small groups for fellowship soon again.</p>
