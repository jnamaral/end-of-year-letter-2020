<p>2024 will be forever marked for Daniel as one of the hardest transitions of his young adult life. He got to stand next to his beloved Grandma Juana as she took her last breath and departed. When Daniel was learning to speak he could not say "Grandma" and instead said "Gaga." The designation stuck in our family. This was before "Lady Gaga" became a phenomenon. Juana was one of Daniel's rocks. Daniel would often call her and spend a long time talking about whatever mattered to Daniel. She would attentively listen and provide her insights. With Juana's passing, the grandparent's home, an important reference anchor for Daniel was sold and his grandpa moved into a new smaller house. It is the end of Christmas traditions that were so important in the first twenty years of Daniel's life.</p>

<p>Late in January, we convinced Daniel to join us for the Department of Computing Science Ski Weekend in Jasper. We took Junior along with us.

Our friends Fred and Gloria traveled from Santos to be with us but caught COVID and could not participate in the celebrations, we met, at a distance, at a park, and outside in the house.
