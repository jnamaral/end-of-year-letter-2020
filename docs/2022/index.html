	 <p>Our after-Christimas time in 2021 was split with first Scott going on one more of his intrepid skiing trips right before the new year, and then I spent a few days in Calgary with my friend Alex. I was due to go to Brazil for a long-delayed visit to Belo Horizonte, but both Alex and I caught COVID during our trip to Calgary. Thus, the trip to Brazil was once more postponed at the last minute. </p>

	  <p>With the changes to the travel plans, Junior kept enjoying more long Winter walks to the dog park. I am often found talking with and petting all kinds of dogs in the dog park. Junior is often referred to as "the happiest dog" and some call me "the dog whisperer." Sometimes Junior would invite a friend to join us. Ricardo, a friend from Mexico, misses his dogs while in Edmonton and thus was keen to join us. </p>

	   <p>In March we managed to go out for lunch with our new friends Dmitri and Olga. They are the parents of my former M.Sc. student Artem Chikin. They were visiting Artem's brother and nephews in Edmonton last Fall when the Russian war against Ukraine started. The combination of Dmitri's past career with the USSR army and his public loud criticism of Putin made it impossible for them to return to Russia without severe consequences. Thus, they requested asylum in Canada. Through them, we had a first-row perspective on what was happening in Russia and with the people of Russia throughout this war. In our conversations, we learned about Dmitri and Olga's interest in classical music.<p>

	  <p>Later in March I finally managed to take my first post-COVID trip and my first stop was in Porto Alegre to see my Mom. We enjoyed spending many days together. We drank lots of Chimarrao and did some cooking together.  My friend Daniel Petry was the one to pick me up at the airport and help me rediscover Porto Alegre. I went to my first live-music concert in years, seeing Ney Lisboa returning to the stage. Daniel Petry also took me to a great stairway live samba in downtown Porto Alegre. At my Mom's place, we had a nice gathering with my nephews and nieces from the Urtassum side of my family. I got to see my sister Salete and my friend Rogerio for the first time in a while and managed to squeeze in a happy hour with our friends Ney and Karin.</p>

It was a great opportunity to go to my aunt Lucia's house for a traditional Churrasco Gaucho. In Florianopolis, I also reconnected with my friend Jader and met his partner for the first time. The shortstop in Florianopolis was very intense with opportunities to reconnect with dear friends.</p>

At the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG) <a href="https://dcc.ufmg.br/10387-2/">they wrote an article about this workshop</a>. Colleagues from Sao Paulo, Niteroi, and other places noticed and I ended up returning to Brazil in September. The students gave me the best Mineira hospitality organizing a happy hour both for my arrival and for my departure. When Daniel heard that they had organized a party for my arrival he said "I did not know that you were that important." Having discovered how much I was missing live music performances, I went seeking concerts in Belo Horizonte. I saw Joao Bosco, a well-known MPB composer and performed, and Jorge Aragao, a great samba composer, delivered great performances. I also made my way to the <i>Clube da Esquina</i> to see a nice band from Belo Horizonte called <i>Get Beattles</i>. My host, Fernando Pereira took me out for lunch to a typical Mineiro restaurant with his family.</p>

  <p>Upon my return from Brazil, with my renovated interest in live music performance, Scott and I invited Dmitri and Olga to join us to go to a concert by the Edmonton Symphonic Orchestra. They were very positively impressed by the quality of the ESO performance, and by the superb Winspear concert hall in Edmonton. Given all the loss and tumult in their lives, the live music experience brought tears to their eyes. We followed that with other live music performances during the year, including a concert given by the organist of London's St. Paul Catedral in the phenomenal Davis Organ at the Winspear, a Symphony-Under-The-Sky performance at Hawrelak park, and a December mixed performance by the orchestra at Concordia University. While attending the organ concert we met with our friend Reva and she recommended that during my upcoming trip to San Diego I should check out the Sunday concert of the Spreckels Organ Pavilion, the largest outdoor musical instrument in the world, at the Balboa Park when I was there. Thus, this was the program when I reencountered Walter Bays, a colleague from my days as a member of the Board of Directors for the Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC).</p>

  <p>This year marked the end of a long run of great soccer and championships by Daniel's Windsor Park Community League Soccer team as the boys reached the age at which they can no longer play youth soccer. They finished their career by winning the City of Edmonton Championship in their age and category -- the only trophy that they had not conquered until now. We had a great time celebrating the season with the now young man and with the great group of parents and coaches that supported them through many seasons.</p>

  <p>My research lab was very busy during the Summer with a record number of undergraduate students preparing material for the Fall teaching and getting started on their research careers. For social events, Junior invited them for a walk in the dog park, and I organized some of the now-traditional cooking-together parties. For these events, I design a menu and gather the equipment and ingredients so that the guests can do all the cooking together. We enjoyed the great weather while cooking outside.</p>

<p>My department has a tradition of organizing board game parties. It is a great way for students and faculty to gather and to have something to do right away when they meet. Groups grab a board game and seat around a table to play. I organized the first Games party after the pandemic in July. We were lucky to have an evening with very nice weather and with no wind. Thus, this turned out to be the first Games party with game tables out in the backyard. At the end of the evening, students were anxiously asking when the next game's party would take place.</p>

<p>If you are wondering what Scott has been during in the middle of my travels and these parties it is time to reveal: he is taking every opportunity that he has to go off to the mountains for skiing or for hiking. Scott has gotten involved with several groups of people that are very interested in these activities. Scott posts interesting trip reports <a href="https://www.facebook.com/scott.meadows.520">in his FB stream</a> along with pictures. In August he even received a visit from Stuart Howe of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HowestheHike?app=desktop">Howe's the Hike youtube</a> fame. Thus, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWtHVtP2XKo&list=PLJqJ_lxM12qlStzCV6Q4x0WPuCXKFcmay&index=4">Scott ended up feature in some Howe's videos</a>. However, in August their plans for a long hike were frustrated by global warming. The unusually higher temperatures in the mountains resulted in much more snow and ice melting leading to small creeks becoming unpassable roaring rivers, and the wildfires made the air in the mountains unbreathable for a while. Thus, they were back earlier than expected from the mountains and we turn lemons into lemonade by organizing a last-minute successful backyard party.</p>

  <p>To celebrate his 18th birthday, Daniel asked if he could "borrow" some of our friends. He picked a few of the people that he knew from our parties to come and have dinner out on the deck and then some great time around a fire that he set up out on our driveway. It turned out to be a great evening where our neighbor Neil connected with our friend John Shaw and with Scott to go on more challenging hikes. Neil had been my companion to going to the theatre earlier in the year when Scott was out hiking.</p>

	  <p>Robina is the daughter of my Ph.D. supervisor, Joydeep Ghosh, in Austin, and Tito is from Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil and completed his Ph.D. at The University of Texas at Austin. Tito and Robina becoming a couple and then Tito taking up a faculty position at the University of Alberta is one of these great coincidences of life. We have enjoyed very much getting acquainted with Tito and getting reacquainted with Robina now as an adult. I was having dinner with them at a restaurant in March when I got a call that Scott's emergency beacon had been activated while he was skiing in the backcountry. It turned out that Scott had dislocated his shoulder and needed a helicopter airlift and a trip to the hospital in an ambulance after spending a night in pain in the middle of a pine forest somewhere between Jasper and Banff. He was fine as soon as his shoulder was put back in place at the hospital.

	    <p>Among the many gatherings in our backyard during the Summer, I managed to organize one for several colleagues from the University of Alberta, including some who have served with me in many of my governance roles at the university. This was a good way to mark my transition from being super involved with many high-level governance committees at the university to disconnecting from all of them. From July 1st, 2022 to June 30th, 2023 I am on sabbatical and thus, instead of my usual teaching and governance work, I have been enjoying a much stronger connection with my industrial research partners.

<p>I returned to Brazil in September. This time to deliver my workshop at the University of S&atilde;o Paulo (USP) where I was very well received by my colleague Alfredo Goldman. The students at USP enjoyed the workshop. While I was in S&atilde;o Paulo my friend Daniel Petry was arriving in S&atilde;o Paulo to take up his new position as a faculty member at USP. Thus, we had a great opportunity to reconnect again. I also reconnected once again with my friend Marcio, who I had also met with Fred and Gloria during my April visit. The weather was not the greatest for my visit to S&atilde;o Paulo: there was cold weather and rain and S&atilde;o Paulo is not the greatest city to move around on rainy days. I managed to include a one-day visit to Unicamp to reconnect in person with my colleague and friend Guido Araujo. After S&atilde;o Paulo I few to Porto Alegre to give a talk at a conference. There I saw many colleagues that I had not seen in a while and went to a very nice dinner at a restaurant named <i>Raven</i>.</p>

It was in Chicago that I consolidated my reputation with Alfredo about picking up good places to eat --- after doing very well in Porto Alegre.

In November I went to Bordeaux to attend SBAC 2022. SBAC is a conference that started many years ago in Brazil. It was the first conference that I ever attended and at the time Jairo Panetta was a well-known professor in the area of High-Performance Computing. It was great to reconnect with him in Bordeaux. I also reconnected with several Brazilian colleagues and was designated, by Alfredo Goldman, as the official selector of restaurants.

 More than a year ago we joined a group in Edmonton to sponsor a family of refugees from Afghanistan. We got connected with this family because the sister of the head of the family already lived in Edmonton and is a classmate of Oriana, our friend Tema and John's daughter, in medical school. This family had already been prosecuted by the Taliban when they were in power before and were afraid for their lives because they belong to a  branch of Islam that believes in educating their daughters. The sponsorship involves a financial commitment as well as other types of support. Their journey was very difficult. They lived for a year in Tajikistan since they fled Afghanistan when the Taliban took over. Our work also involved exerting political pressure on the Canadian government to bring them to Canada when their situation was a very difficult one. <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/their-life-is-in-limbo-edmonton-woman-fears-for-safety-of-afghan-family-waiting-in-tajikistan-1.6589737">This CBC interview</a> gives some background on the situation. Thus, it was with great relief that we were able to welcome the Afghanyar family to Edmonton in November. There are six of them. In December we were able to join them for a dinner cooked by them featuring a delicious Afghan delicacy called <a href="https://tasteoftheplace.com/afghanmantu/">Mantu</a>. They are settling in Edmonton. Just a few weeks after arrival some of them already have jobs and others are in school.

	  <p> As many of the encounters described in this letter are evidence, reconnecting with friends is one of the greatest things about traveling again. Today, December 27, I had another very special moment. Pedro and I go back to 1988 when we were classmates for our M.Sc. program at the <i>Instituto Tecnologico de Aeronautica</i> (ITA). Pedro is one of the special friends with whom I remain close in spite of time and distance. Today I drove down from Ardmore in Oklahoma to Dallas in Texas for a lunch chat with Pedro. Our chat extended for several hours and it was a great feeling to be talking with my attentive friend once again. When I was at ITA Pedro was the one that brought me to Jairo Panetta's seminars at the <i>Instituto Militar the Engenharia</i> (IME). And it was also Pedro who invited me to attend the first SBAC and the first conference of my life in 1988.
