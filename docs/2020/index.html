<p>In the past few years, Daniel developed anxiety about flying. All our flights with him have been challenging. But, something happened in our last flight together. We were flying back from Oklahoma to Edmonton on Dec. 31st 2019 and Daniel had Junior, a two-and-a-half-month old Westie puppy by his feet. Daniel remained calm and relaxed throughout the flight, always concerned about how Junior was doing. In the year since, Junior has done his job of calming, understanding, and cuddling in many times of need. Junior has been a great company to me and Scott as well. Junior also brought us out and let us to make new friends in the neighborhood throughout the Summer. And, now in the Winter, Junior leads us to walks on snow-covered trails in the dog park almost daily.</p>

<p>In January, soon after our Christmas-after-Christmas party, upon arriving early one morning at my office at the University I learned about an airplane crash in Teeran. A couple of hours later I heard dramatic crying and sobbing outside of my office door. Those were the first sounds of the unraveling of a very close tragedy. Many members of the University of Alberta community, and some graduate students from our own department, were among the victims --- including the just-married couple that became known around the world after their death, as were kids from the grade school a block away from our house. We have a large number of Persian students and some professors from Iran as well. We organize games parties at professor's house where we gather to play board games. Many of the Persian students attend these parties. We had one such party at a friends house on December 7th. Thus, the games party that we organized at the end of February was already meaningful because it was the first one that we held after that tragedy. We did not know at the time that it would also be the last time we gather for a long while.</p>

<p>In my peripathetic existence as an active researcher, I went to Bologna on January 20th to present the work of one of my students at a conference, came back and a few days later was in Freemont in California for my reelection to the Board of Directors for the Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC). And then, late in February, right before travel restrictions, I attended a major international conference in San Diego where I met many colleagues from around the world and talked with friends old and new. I recall lunches outdoors on the lawn by the lake on sunny days in February -- a luxury if you live in Edmonton, long conversations with my friend and collaborator Guido Araujo form Campinas, and a long conversation, that spanned the entire evening at Sea World, with Ayal Zaks, a colleague from Technion, the Israel Institute of Technology, about research, research philosophy, and life. At that moment, I felt how much these deep interactions with people that live far away are valuable. In retrospect, those moments were even more important. While we were mingling in San Diego with people from all over the world, China had shut down Wuhan and their measurements were criticized in the media for been authoritarian. A good friend from China commented on what would the USA do if the virus got to its major cities. How would they contain it? Now we know.</p>

<p>In between my busy teaching in the 2019 Fall and my travels in January, I was also very busy with the process of serving in the committee charged to select the new president for the University. After a long and laborious process the committee select William Flanagan, the former Dean of the Faculty of Law at Queen's University, in Kingston, Ontario. Bill is the first openly gay president of a Canadian university. From my experience with him during the selection process, Bill would do well with in-person meetings and interactions. Unfortunately Bill and his husband, Szafron, arrived in Edmonton in he midst of a pandemic that prevents most in-person engagements. </p>  

<p> I had a planned research trip to Toronto in March. There were lots of questions about taking the trip as the news about the virus were changing each day. My position was that, as long as they were playing hockey to crowded arenas, it was not serious and I would not change my plans. The pandemic was declared, the hockey stopped, and I cancelled the trip. Life became very different. I went from not staying for a full month in the country to not leaving Windsor Park (my neighborhood in Edmonton) for six weeks of more. Both university and Daniel's school were moved online and we were now all together home all the time.</p>

<p>Scott is the president of the Windsor Park Community League. Their meetings also were moved online. And his chorus practices were also cancelled.</p>

<p>I started a pandemic project in March as soon as it was warm enough to be outside. Our house was built in the 1950s and has nice Cedar wood sidings. But they had been painted with many layers of paint over the years. Where the walls receive more sun exposure the underlayers of paint were failing creating cracks in the paint. The only durable solution was to remove all the old paint to strip tghe sidings down to the bare wood which required a painstaking process with a small heat gun. Then the sindings had to be sanded, primed and painted. Most of the nails were also rusted and needed to be replaced with new galvanized ones and the old nail holes had to be patched up and sanded. It was a very long and laborious process. But, it was a project took me outside by myself, for a couple of hours every day in the late afternoons and early evenings during the weeks and for longer periods on the weekends. Being alone, away from my housemates, often with Junior companion, helped us all keep our sanity. The pandemic project was officially over in the end of July.</p>

<p>As the news about the pandemic changed daily in March, we had to quickly find alternative ways to host the International Conference on Performance Engineering. This was the first of two major international conferences that I had volunteered to host in Edmonton in 2020. We had to make up as we went along, but in the end we created a model combining pre-recorded videos, live questions-and-answer sessions, and an app for comunication. It was a lot of work to cancel the original plans and to create the support for the online version. By many accounts the April conference was a success. </p>

<p>The pandemic required several changes to the university rules and regulations and made my service to governance in the university much busier. A decision that was quite controversial was the conversion of all Winter courses from grade to credit/no-credit. The provincial government has handed down a historical budget cut to the University budget leading to a very difficult situation during the pandemic.</p>

 
<p>The May warmer weather allowed us to also get busy with our vegetable garden and daily walks with junior in the neighborhood. This year the students living in Dorothy's house next door decided to tend to the vegetable patch at the back. I helped them by lending tools, seeds, and advise. It was great fun interacting with them accross the chainlink the fence. Throughout the Summer I had an active group of students working on research and also on the preparations for the online versions of my undergraduate courses for the Fall term. Given that everyone was working from their homes, I set up a regular daily Zoom meeting every day of the week at 9 AM. Thus, I soon fell into a pattern of taking Junior for a morning walk --- it was our litter-collecting walk and Juniour thruly enjoyed lingering at many spots sniffing around while I picked up litter --- and came back to the meeting with my students. We had other meetings during the day and research seminars that included some of my former students who were also working from home. From time to time we would have brief "social bumps" moments in smaller groups to talk about non-work events. Many students welcomed these interactions.</p>

<p>The Summer brought occasions to interact at safe physical distance outdoors. We even managed to have a few physical-distance dinners in the patio at our house and at friends' houses. Evening dog walks were long and Junior enjoyed many long plays in the community skating rink with other dogs while we chatted with fellow dog owners. There were several outdoor concerts in the neighborhood that we attended. Instead of our traditional Summer garden party, Daniel's birthday was celebrated with a very small group of friends out in the patio.</p>

<p>Scott also managed to take a few solo trips to hike in the mountains. In one of these trips he was joined by our friend John Shaw to hike over a glacier and reach a lovely meadow. Unfortunately John twisted his foot. He bravely continued to the end of the planned hike to find out that he had walked on a broken foot for two days.</p>

<p>In August was the International Conference on Parallel Processing, the second major conference that I had voluneered to organize in Edmonton. It was again a lot of work because many of the new coordination for the online conference had to be done by me. Luckily we could draw on the experience from ICPE in April and I had several of my own students working as volunteers to ensure that the parallel sessions went smoothly.</p>

<p>The last two weeks of August were for final preparation for the term. I also participated in many online seminars presenting ideas about how to teach effectively online. Getting a good setup to produce quality lecture video recordings took a lot of time. With the start of the term in September my life became super busy. I opted for pre-recording all the content for my lectures in 20-minute videos and then have synchronous Zoom meetings with students in each class twice a week. In these synchronous sessions I brought additional problems for students to work in groups of three or four in breakout sessions. I would spend my time going through the sessions. I also developed quizzes for each video lecture, we had lots of homework, hands-on course projects, and much more frequent assessments, which I had to learn to set up properly online. It was a lot of work for myself, for the teaching assistants, and for the students, but it kept the students engaged. I have received many messages from students indicating that they thought that the courses were very well delivered. I also used the social bumps in the class where I would send students to small breakout sessions at the start of the class for them to chat a bit about non-class related subjects. The idea is the one of a casual meeting on the hallway or standing in line for service somewhere. The casual conversation in these moments help students to get to know other students in the class. Some students said that it did not even feel that it was an online course. Others students, living alone, said that they looked forward to each sycrhonous class because it was the only time that they would interact with others going through the same thing that they were going through.</p>

<p>The University Board of Governors, and the new president, decided to implement many drastic changes to the governance of the university. Along with many colleagues, we did not agree with the changes. Thus, in the Fall term I found myself very busy again in University governance trying to aboid the worst of these changes.</p>

<p>With the end of the Summer, I no longer had 9 AM student meetings daily. The University swimming pool had openned, thus my new routine was to hit the pool at 8 AM whenever I did not have an early morning meeting and make back home to start my classes. Daniel has done online school from the start of the pandemic. When Daniel was nine he ended up in intensive care when he contract the flu virus. We suspect that he may have the type of immuno system that would overreact to COVID. Moreover, he suffers from asthma and is overweighted. We do not want to take a chance to find out if our concerns are founded. During the Summer he played some soccer in small co-horts and with lots of protocols for physical distancing --- Daniel is goalie, which makes distancing more feaseable. In the Fall, soccer went indoors and, after long deliberations, we agreed that he would play. There were many protocols to try to prevent transmission, but it was still a risk --- even more so because most members of the team were going to school every day. Daniel also got into a routine of going to workout, alongside his COVID buddy, with a trainer several times a week.</p>

<p>In november a brother of one of the soccer team players tested positive for COVID. All soccer activities for the team were suspended for a week. During that time came the provincial-mandated shut down of the schools and of all team-sport activities. The gym also closed. Swimming pools remained open for a couple of more weeks, but eventually also shut down. We agreed that Daniel and his buddy would keep seeing each other. His parents are colleagues of mine at the university and they have been self isolating as well. Right before Chirstmas we got a fire pit to put in the driveway so that they can spend sometime outside instead of spending all the time playing video games. Now the sports complex were I would go swim, two blocks from our house, is been prepared to become a COVID field hospital.</p>

<p>My new pandemic project at the end of the school semester in December was to give myself a Christmas present: several of Ottolenghi's cookbooks. I knew very little about him. I knew he is an Israeli chef in London. Our friend Kathleen Thurber cooked from his cookbooks and highly recommends. We had a few delicious Ottolenghi dishes cooked by her in the last few years. Since I got the books, I have learned that Ottolenghi is a married gay man with a son through surrogacy. His co-author, Sami Tamimi, who is Israeli of Palestinian parents, is also gay. They grew up in close physical proximity, but apart, in a culturally divided Jerusalem and met in London. Ottolenghi's new co-author, Ixta Belfrage, has a Brazilian mother, relatives in Mexico, grew up in Italy, and lived in Australia. During the Winter break i have been experimenting with lots of recipes from these collection of cookbooks. It is a bit of travelling through food, using different herbs, spices, and condiments and reading about the food traditions of Jerusalem and how the many migrations of Jews from all corners of the world have influenced it.</p>

<p>After months of very long days in front of the computer -- video recording, teaching, meetings, preparation, web pages, reviews, reading, setting exams, grading was all online -- I needed time off from the screen. Thus, as soon as the exams passed, I decided to spend some time cleaning and organizing the house and going for long walks. It was a great mental break and this is why this letter is late this year. We set up table cloths, prepared a very nice Christmas dinner -- I made Scott's grandma traditional pies, and we gathered with some friends and our mothers over Zoom or on the phone. Daniel kept asking if he would get any Christmas presents this year. We said nothing, but on Christmas morning he was surprised by many wrapped presents on top of the coffee table.</p>

<p>We hear lots of talk about the difficulties of this pandemic year. The loss is great. It certainly was also a very different year from what we all had expected. I foresee that in the future we will look back and long for some of the things that we were able to do during this time. There was more quiet times at home. We were able to engage in projects for which we never had time before. We were able to slow down from our busy lives and to focus on some things that are very important. We had small concerts on the street or on the park that felt intimate. We stopped for longer to talk with neighbors while walking the dog. We were reminded to not take anything for granted.</p>

<p>A friend asked what we miss the most during this time. For me it is overheard conversations. Whether sitting around a dinner table, socializing in a group, sitting at a cafe or at an airport terminal, I often engaged into listening carefully to other people's normal conversation and trying to picture their phisolophy, outlook in life, and the realities that led to such conversations. It was also a great aspect of traveling. Online interactions do not allow for that, and the very limited physical-distance interactions do not allow me to observe other people interact. Thus, here longing for a day when we can again observe our fellow humans going about their life and we can again learn from them.</p>


	  <p>Hoping that you make the most of these quiet times.</p>
